# An Introduction to Jetpack Compose

This repository documents my initial and early stages of experimenting with Jetpack Compose and Kotlin. The focus of this project is to explore the capabilities and features of Jetpack Compose in building Android applications.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have developed a simple tip calculator application. The key aspects of this application include:

- **Usage of Jetpack Compose**: Implementing modern UI designs in Kotlin.
- **Reusable Widgets**: Demonstrating how to create and utilize reusable components in Jetpack Compose.
- **Simple State Management**: Leveraging `remember` and `mutableStateOf` for managing the application's state effectively.
